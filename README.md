# Fortune Cookie Factory Assignment

Welcome to the Fortune Cookie Assignment project! This repository contains my study assignment focused on fortune cookie messages. The primary concept of this project is to explore the idea that lucky messages can come true sooner if we dominate or help less fortunate people.

## Overview

- The project is based on the study of fortune cookie messages and their potential impact on individuals.

- It explores the hypothesis that acting on the positive or lucky messages in fortune cookies can lead to improved outcomes, especially if we extend this positivity to less fortunate individuals.

## Usage

- The assignment may include data analysis, surveys, or experiments related to fortune cookies and their messages.

- As a result of these messages, it aims to provide insights into the psychological and practical effects of taking proactive action.

## Contributions
